## Simplifying Finding Parking ##

### The ability to post and find parking spots easily. ###
Many great parking apps exist and provide assistance to the stressed and overwhelmed city driver.  However, we found that most focus on paid parking garages or only provide insight into parking regulations.  We realized a need for a community of parkers who can tip each other off to street parking spots coming available in real time.  

### The Solution ###
While hunting for a spot in a busy mall parking lot, our founder had an exchange with a departing shopper who led him to thier spot that they were leaving. 'I should charge you for this!' joked the shopper as they got in their car to depart.  Realizing that after having circled the lot, he would have happily paid, the idea of Spot Swap was born. An online community of parkers who conveniently and safely let each other know when they're about to leave a parking spot now scales the act of following the shopper to parking lots and city streets everywhere!


## How to Get Started ##
